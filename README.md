# Optimal Mobility Hub Deployment for the 15-Minute City
This project focuses on the timely and impactful theme of the "**15-minute city**". The 15-minute city concept envisions a **sustainable urban environment** where essential activities such as living, working, commerce, health care, education, and entertainment are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from one's home.

**Project Objective:** <br>
Using datasets such as MobiDataLab Codagon, this project aims to propose an **intelligent deployment strategy for mobility hubs** in Louvain (a Belgian city with around 100,000 inhabitants). The goal is to ensure maximum coverage of the 15-minute city measures, creating a **well-connected urban environment** that promotes accessibility and efficiency.

**Technical Approach:** <br>
**Isochrone curve** approach or simulation tools like **SUMO** for walkability-rideability measures. Experiment with different routing approaches to determine the optimal placement of mobility hubs. Consider factors such as minimizing travel time, respecting population density, or sacrificing some zones to achieve an average travel time below 15 minutes.

**Key Tasks:** <br>
_Data Exploration_: Utilize MobiDataLab Codagon or similar datasets to understand the existing mobility patterns and requirements in Louvain.

_Deployment Strategies_: Implement different policies for mobility hub deployment, such as minimizing travel time for selected zones, optimizing for an average travel time across multiple zones, or aligning with population density.

_Technical Implementation_: Use isochrone curves, SUMO, or alternative routing approaches to simulate and analyze the 15-minute walkability-rideability measures.

_Coherent Discussion_: Develop a comprehensive discussion outlining the findings, advantages, and drawbacks of each deployment strategy. Address the impact on travel time, population density, and the overall feasibility of the 15-minute city concept in Louvain.
